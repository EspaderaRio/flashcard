Calculus Fundamentals

Limits and Continuity:
A function f(x) is continuous at x = a if:
1. f(a) exists
2. lim(x→a) f(x) exists
3. lim(x→a) f(x) = f(a)

Derivative Rules:
1. Power Rule: d/dx[x^n] = n*x^(n-1)
2. Product Rule: d/dx[f*g] = f'*g + f*g'
3. Quotient Rule: d/dx[f/g] = (f'*g - f*g')/g²
4. Chain Rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)

Integration Techniques:
1. Power Rule: ∫x^n dx = x^(n+1)/(n+1) + C
2. Substitution: ∫f(g(x))g'(x) dx = ∫f(u) du
3. Integration by Parts: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du
4. Partial Fractions: For rational functions

Linear Algebra:
Vector Operations:
- Addition: (a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d)
- Scalar Multiplication: k(a,b) = (ka, kb)
- Dot Product: (a,b) · (c,d) = ac + bd

Matrix Operations:
- Addition: A + B = [a_ij + b_ij]
- Multiplication: (AB)_ij = Σ_k a_ik * b_kj
- Transpose: (A^T)_ij = a_ji
- Inverse: A * A^(-1) = I

Differential Equations:
First Order:
- Separable: dy/dx = f(x)g(y) → ∫g(y)dy = ∫f(x)dx
- Linear: dy/dx + P(x)y = Q(x)
- Exact: M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0

Second Order:
- Homogeneous: ay'' + by' + cy = 0
- Particular Solution: Assume form based on right-hand side
- Variation of Parameters

Probability Theory:
Basic Concepts:
- Sample Space: Set of all possible outcomes
- Event: Subset of sample space
- Probability: P(E) = |E| / |S| for equally likely outcomes

Conditional Probability:
P(A|B) = P(A∩B) / P(B)

Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A)P(A)] / P(B)

Random Variables:
- Discrete: Countable outcomes
- Continuous: Uncountable outcomes
- Expected Value: E[X] = Σx*P(X=x) or ∫x*f(x)dx
- Variance: Var(X) = E[X²] - (E[X])²
