Basic Electronics Concepts

Introduction to Electronics

What is Electronics?
Electronics is the branch of physics and technology that deals with the behavior and control of electrons and the electrical devices that use them.

Basic Components:

1. Resistor (R)
   - Purpose: Limits current flow
   - Symbol: ---
   - Unit: Ohms (Ω)

2. Capacitor (C)
   - Purpose: Stores electrical charge
   - Symbol: --|--
   - Unit: Farads (F)

3. Inductor (L)
   - Purpose: Stores energy in magnetic field
   - Symbol: ⥮⥮⥮
   - Unit: Henry (H)

4. Diode (D)
   - Purpose: Allows current in one direction
   - Symbol: >|
   - Types: Rectifier, Zener, LED

Ohm's Law:
V = I × R
Where:
- V = Voltage (Volts)
- I = Current (Amperes)
- R = Resistance (Ohms)

Power Formula:
P = V × I
Where:
- P = Power (Watts)

Series Circuits:
- Total Resistance: R_total = R1 + R2 + R3 + ...
- Same current through all components
- Voltage divides among components

Parallel Circuits:
- Total Resistance: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ...
- Same voltage across all components
- Current divides among components

Digital Logic:
- 0 = Low voltage (0V)
- 1 = High voltage (typically 3.3V or 5V)

Basic Logic Gates:
- AND: Output is 1 only if all inputs are 1
- OR: Output is 1 if any input is 1
- NOT: Output is opposite of input
- NAND: NOT of AND
- NOR: NOT of OR
- XOR: Output is 1 if inputs are different

Safety Precautions:
1. Always discharge capacitors before working
2. Use proper tools and equipment
3. Work with power off when possible
4. Use appropriate protective gear
5. Know location of emergency equipment

Common Tools:
- Multimeter: Measures voltage, current, resistance
- Oscilloscope: Displays voltage waveforms over time
- Soldering iron: For making permanent connections
- Breadboard: For prototyping circuits
